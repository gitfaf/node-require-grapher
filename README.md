# node-require-grapher

Graph require() calls in nodejs.

By graph I mean scribble them in console.

## Usage

```bash

    npm i -D node-require-grapher

```

```javascript

    // in the main file (the one you described in package.json) or whereever you want
    require('node-require-grapher')();

    // then just run your node application

```
